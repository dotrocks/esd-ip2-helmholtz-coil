\chapter{Abstract}

This project aims to investigate the creation and properties of a uniform magnetic field using Helmholtz coil. Helmholtz coil consist of two identical circular coils with a specific configuration designed to generate a nearly uniform magnetic field in a certain volume of space. This report covers the theoretical background, derivation of the magnetic field equations, experimental setup, simulation results, and analysis of the Helmholtz coil system in a circuit.
