\chapter{Introduction}

Obtaining a uniform magnetic field is crucial in many physical experiments and for the operation of various electrical and electronic devices. The Helmholtz coil system, consisting of two identical coils, is a common solution for producing such a field. This project explores the conditions under which the magnetic field is most uniform and provides a detailed analysis of the system.
