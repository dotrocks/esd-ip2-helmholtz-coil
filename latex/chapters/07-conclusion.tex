\chapter{Conclusion}

This project demonstrates the design and analysis of Helmholtz coil to achieve a uniform magnetic field. The theoretical derivations align with the experimental and simulation results, confirming the optimal configuration for uniformity. The study also provides insights into the coil's inductance and behavior in a circuit with varying frequencies and amplitudes.
