# Integrated Project#2 - Helmholtz Coil Analysis

Project files for the second integrated project of the ESD Capsule at Abdullah Gül University, Spring 2024.

This project aims to investigate the creation and properties of a uniform magnetic field using Helmholtz coil. Helmholtz coil consist of two identical circular coils with a specific configuration designed to generate a nearly uniform magnetic field in a certain volume of space. This report covers the theoretical background, derivation of the magnetic field equations, experimental setup, simulation results, and analysis of the Helmholtz coil system in a circuit.

This project consists of X parts:

- **PHYS104 & MATH154:** Theoretical background and derivation of the magnetic field equations.
- **PHYS104 & EE201:** Experimental setup and inductance measurements.

**NOTE:** Please note that the calculations on the report may not be accurate, as the project was done in my freshman year and I was not very familiar with the concepts at that time. I want to keep this project as a reference for my future self and for anyone who may find it useful.
